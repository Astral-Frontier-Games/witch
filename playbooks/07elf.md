name: The Elf
xp-trigger: Address a problem via your uniqueness
touchstones: Dobby, Alfur
desc: |-
  You don't have to be a literal elf, but you're some sort of magical nonÂ­human companion, like a fairy
  being or familiar. You have your own magic and don't tend to cast spells like other characters. You
  can break the rules of magic within your domain, but are bound in ways others aren't.
specialtrappings: |-
  You don't use a normal witch's trappings.
  Instead, your special abilities follow unique rules and obey unique restrictions.
  Define what those are before the game begins.
