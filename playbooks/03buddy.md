  You're mostly here to have fun. Casting spells and doing magic is neat, but you're more
  interested in supporting your friends. Your special thing is the inspiration and wonder that you
  create just by being yourself.

      when you share something
      personal, like a story or souvenier, with a friend,
      and they respond positively, you both clear 1
      stress. When you assist someone in a way that
      references something you've shared in the past,
      and they mark Friendship, you don't mark
      stress.
